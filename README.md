# [Portfolio] (https://katgrace0808.github.io/Portfolio-Kathryn-Teall/)

Portfolio website to introduce myself and present my work and projects.  

## Description

This is a portfolio website that is showcasing the work I have accomplished thus far that is exemplary.  It is a work in progress as I continue the UW Coding Bootcamp course.  The application opens to an About Me page.  The user is presented with my photo and a short bio. At the top of the page is a navigation bar that provides links to a Contact page and a Porfolio page.  

The Contact page allows a user to contac me with questions or comments.  **This is not working at the moment**

The Portfolio page provides images for each of work that are links to their respective Github pages.  This page also contains a section for Projects.  The project shows a screenshot of the deployed site, and also provide a link to the website and the Github page.

At the bottom, the user is able to find links to my email, a PDF of my resume, and links to my LinkIn and Github pages.
